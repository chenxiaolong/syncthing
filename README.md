This repo contains a fork of syncthing used by [BasicSync](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/BasicSync). The only addition is the ability to pause all network activity and shut down listening sockets without persisting any changes to the config.

The commits are published as part of the `<version>-basicsync.<revision>` tags.
